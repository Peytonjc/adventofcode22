# Advent of Code 2022
Welcome to my repository of solutions to the Advent of Code 2022!

Advent of Code is an annual event where programmers are challenged to solve a series of increasingly difficult coding puzzles. Each day, a new puzzle is released, and participants compete to write the most efficient and elegant solution. Puzzles can be found here: https://adventofcode.com/2022

This repository contains my solutions to the Advent of Code 2022 puzzles. I have attempted to write clear, well-documented code that is easy to understand. I am primarily using Python.
